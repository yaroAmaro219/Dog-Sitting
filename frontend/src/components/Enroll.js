                <p class='waiver'>Liability Release and Parental Consent Form
                In consideration of the acceptance of my application for the summer recreation program, I hereby waive,
                release, and discharge any and all claims for damages for personal injury, property damages or which may
                hereafter occur to my child as a result of their participation in said summer program. This release is intended to
                discharge in advance the Town of Clinton, its officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and agents from
                liability, even though that liability may arise out of perceived negligence on the part of persons mentioned
                above. It is understood that some recreational activities involve an element of risk or danger of accidents, and
                knowing those risks, I hereby assume those risks. It is further understood and agreed that this waiver, release,
                and assumption of risk is to be binding on my heirs and assignees.

                <p class='waiver'>
                  I hereby give my consent to have the above applicant treated by emergency medical personnel or a physician in
                  the case of sudden illness or injury while participating in any Prospect Park Tennis Camp activities. It is
                  understood that Prospect Park Tennis Camp will provide no medical insurance for such treatment, and that the
                  cost thereof will be at my expense.
                  I have read and understood the foregoing registration liability release and parental consent form, and
agree to all of its terms and conditions. </p>
                <h3>COVID Protocals</h3>
                <p class='waiver'>
                I acknowledge the contagious nature of the Coronavirus/COVID-19 and that the CDC and many other public
                health authorities still recommend practicing social distancing.
                I further acknowledge that Prospect Park Tennis Camp, nor its instructors and/or coaches, cannot guarantee
                that I will not become infected with the Coronavirus/COVID-19. I understand that the risk of becoming
                exposed to and/or infected by the Coronavirus/COVID-19 may result from the actions, omissions, or
                negligence of myself and others, including, but not limited to, salon staff, and other salon clients and their
                families.
                I voluntarily seek services provided by Prospect Park Tennis Camp and acknowledge that I am increasing my
                risk to exposure to the Coronavirus/COVID-19. I acknowledge that I must comply with all set procedures to
                reduce the spread while attending my appointment.
                I attest that:
                * I am not experiencing any symptom of illness such as cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
                fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or                smell.
                * I have not traveled internationally within the last 14 days.
                * I have not traveled to a highly impacted area within the United States of America in the last 14 days.
                * I do not believe I have been exposed to someone with a suspected and/or confirmed case of the
                Coronavirus/COVID-19.
                * I have not been diagnosed with Coronavirus/COVID-19 and not yet cleared as non-contagious by state or
                local public health authorities.
                * I am following all CDC recommended guidelines as much as possible and limiting my exposure to the
                Coronavirus/COVID-19.
                I hereby release and agree to hold Prospect Park Tennis Camp harmless from, and waive on behalf of myself,
                my heirs, and any personal representatives any and all causes of action, claims, demands, damages, costs,
                expenses and compensation for damage or loss to myself and/or property that may be caused by any act, or
                failure to act of the camp, or that may otherwise arise in any way in connection with any services received
                from Prospect Park Tennis Camp. I understand that this release discharges Prospect Park Tennis Camp from
                any liability or claim that I, my heirs, or any personal representatives may have against the salon with                respect
                to any bodily injury, illness, death, medical treatment, or property damage that may arise from, or in
                connection to, any services received from Prospect Park Tennis Camp. This liability waiver and release
                extends to the salon together with all owners, partners, and employees.
